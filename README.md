Dual Moving Average Crossover Option: an exotic option with a binary payoff that is triggered when two specified simple moving averages (SMAs) of the underlying asset cross each other. The option pays a fixed amount ($1) if the crossover event occurs during the observation period, and nothing otherwise.
